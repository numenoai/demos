# Numeno Demos

This repository contains demos for the Numeno APIs. It's a great place to learn Numeno. Use the code in these projects as the basis of your own Numeno integrations.

Be sure to check out the complete [Documentation for the Numeno APIs](https://numeno.ai/wp-content/uploads/docs/).

If you have built something with Numeno, we'd love to see it! [Reach out to us](mailto:contact@numeno.ai).

# Available Demos

Please see below for a list of the available demos in this repo.

## Numeno Feeds Slack App
This project implements the backend of a Slackbot command for Numeno Feeds that fetches articles from a Numeno Article Recommender Feed and publishes them to a Slack channel. The PHP scripts are designed for a WordPress site, but the routes can be easly changed for a non-Wordpress host.
