# Numeno Demos

This repository contains demos for the Numeno APIs. It's a great place to learn Numeno. Use the code in these projects as the basis of your own Numeno integrations.

Be sure to check out the complete [Documentation for the Numeno APIs](https://numeno.ai/wp-content/uploads/docs/).

## Numeno Feeds Slack App
This project implements the backend of a Slackbot command for Numeno Feeds that fetches articles from a Numeno Article Recommender Feed and publishes them to a Slack channel. The PHP scripts are designed for a WordPress site, but the routes can be easly changed for a non-Wordpress host.

## TypeScript Example Code
This code uses the native TypeScript library walks you through how to administer Keys and Scopes, create Feeds and manipulate Streams, all with the Numeno TypeScript API wrapper.
