# Numeno Demos

This repository contains demos for the Numeno APIs. It's a great place to learn Numeno. Use the code in these projects as the basis of your own Numeno integrations.

Be sure to check out the complete [Documentation for the Numeno APIs](https://numeno.ai/wp-content/uploads/docs/).

## Numeno Feeds Slack App

This project implements the backend of a Slackbot command for Numeno Feeds that fetches articles from a Numeno Article Recommender Feed and publishes them to a Slack channel. The PHP scripts are designed for a WordPress site, but the routes can be easly changed for a non-Wordpress host.
